PipeForge is a lightweight, composable pipeline framework for .NET. It makes step-based processing simple, discoverable, and testable. Inspired by middleware pipelines and modern dependency injection patterns, PipeForge gives you structured control over sequential logic flows - without the ceremony.

## Installation

PipeForge is available on [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PipeForge/) and can be installed using a NuGet package manager or the .NET CLI.

## Usage and Support

- Check out the project documentation https://scottoffen.github.io/pipeforge.

- Engage in our [community discussions](https://github.com/scottoffen/pipeforge/discussions) for Q&A, ideas, and show and tell!

- Have a question you can't find an answer for in the documentation or discussions? You can ask your questions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) using [#pipeforge](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pipeforge?sort=newest). Make sure you include the version of PipeForge you are using, the platform you using it on, code samples and any specific error messages you are seeing.

- **Issues created to ask "how to" questions will be closed.**

## Use Cases

While PipeForge is fundamentally a pipeline framework, it can also serve as the foundation for higher-level workflows. These workflows are built by composing individual pipeline steps that handle branching, retries, fallbacks, and decision logic â€” making it ideal for orchestrating complex processes like AI chains, data enrichment, or multi-stage validation.

| | |
|-|-|
| Middleware-Style Request Processing | Build lightweight, modular request pipelines similar to ASP.NET middleware, without requiring a full web host. |
| DevOps and Automation Pipelines | Express deployment checks, file transforms, and system hooks as repeatable, testable steps. |
| Security and Auditing Pipelines | Enforce policies, redact sensitive data, and log events in a structured, traceable flow. |
| ETL and Data Processing Pipelines | Break down validation, transformation, and persistence into clean, maintainable processing steps. |
| LLM and AI Workflows | Orchestrate prompt generation, model calls, fallback handling, and response parsing using composable pipelines. |
| Business Logic and Domain Orchestration | Replace brittle `if` chains and nested logic with clearly structured rule execution and orchestration flows. |
